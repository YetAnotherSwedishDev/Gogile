# Product Owner (PO)
The product owner is responsible for generating and communicating the holes/goals. They should be confident that the goal actually contributes to the course/milestone objectives.

They should participate in all stroke planning together with developers, to ensure the next stroke/task is towards the goal.

They should align with stakeholders and together with DM and PM make sure goals can be created to get to the course/milestone objectinves.

# Delivery Manager (DM)
The delivery manager is responsible for maintaining the course/milestone objective plans. They should ensure that the overall plan will get the product to the state the stakeholders want and that the correct resources are in place.

They should align with other delivery managers to ensure synergies and dependencies between projects are handled in an optimal manner.

# Product Manager (PM)
The product manager is the main stakeholder. They should align with all stakeholders to gather the input needed to supply enough information to the delivery manager and product owner for them to make fulfill their respective responsibilities.

They are the deciding power, when it comes to what the minimum viable product is.

# Business Analyst (BA)

# Tester
The tester needs to be involved in hole/goal planning. They should make sure the goal that the PO and developer agree on is testable, once completed. Once the developer starts work, the tester should focus on writing test cases for the goal and evaluate if testing can be automated.

# Caddie
The caddie's role is to support the developer during the hole. The caddie should provide guidance when planning strokes/tasks and when the developer runs into impediments or unforseen problems. Usually it's an experienced developer and/or someone with specific knowledge/skills.

The caddie is not a permanent role, instead it is defined and appointed when needed for a specific hole. Any team member can act as a caddie.

There can be several caddies during a hole. They can share the support workload and also provide different kinds of expertise, e.g. a front end caddie and a database caddie etc.

The caddie(s) should be clearly appointed before starting the hole and should be available throughout the hole.
